    <h2>Full Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      My journey through the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program has been transformative, equipping me with a diverse skill set and the confidence to tackle real-world challenges in software development. This capstone project serves as the culmination of my academic experience, showcasing my growth in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. It also demonstrates my ability to synthesize knowledge from various courses into a cohesive portfolio that highlights my technical expertise and professional readiness.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths and Growth</h3>
    <p>
      Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has significantly shaped my strengths and professional goals. I have grown as a collaborative team member, a technical problem solver, and a communicator, which are essential skills in the computer science field. Specific areas of growth include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collaborating in a Team Environment:</strong> Working on projects such as [specific project or class name], I honed my ability to share ideas effectively, divide tasks, and deliver solutions that align with team objectives. This experience has prepared me to thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams in the workplace.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicating with Stakeholders:</strong> Initially, I felt uncertain during the code review process, but with practice and guidance, I became more confident. My code review video now reflects my ability to explain code functionality, planned enhancements, and alignment with industry standards to an audience with varying technical expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> Enhancing my artifact for this category involved implementing efficient data structures and refining logic for performance, reflecting a strong foundation in problem-solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Software Engineering and Design:</strong> The enhancements I made to my artifact demonstrate my ability to produce clean, modular code, adhere to best practices, and implement secure coding principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> I applied advanced database concepts, including the use of prepared statements for security, detailed schema design, and optimized queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges and Problem-Solving</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the capstone project, I encountered challenges that required adaptability and persistence. For instance, integrating error handling and logging in my database module required a deep dive into best practices for robust software design. Similarly, transitioning to GitHub Pages for hosting my portfolio involved learning about UI/UX principles to ensure that my portfolio is not only functional but also user-friendly and professional.
    </p>
    <h3>Future Directions</h3>
    <p>
      This ePortfolio is a reflection of my academic achievements and technical skills, but it is also a starting point for continuous learning. As I enter the professional field, I plan to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expand my knowledge in areas like cloud computing and machine learning.</li>
      <li>Contribute to open-source projects to further develop my coding and collaboration skills.</li>
      <li>Seek opportunities where I can apply my expertise in software design and database management to create impactful solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This ePortfolio represents my dedication to mastering computer science principles and my readiness to contribute value in the professional world. By presenting a cohesive and polished portfolio, I aim to position myself as a candidate who not only understands technical challenges but can also deliver innovative solutions. My journey through the program has prepared me to excel in the ever-evolving field of computer science, and I am excited to apply my skills to real-world challenges.
